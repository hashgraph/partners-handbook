## Decentralization memorandum

Being a public DLT network, one of Hedera's superpowers lies in the power of its community.

We believe that together we can deliver a future where decentralized technologies reach their potential through community contribution.

In the spirit of this ideology, we call for your support in building the best Partner onboarding experience.

This guide is a living document that evolves with the community. We encourage you to give us feedback on this document and contribute to it.

# What makes a successful Hedera Partner?

Our most successful SI Partners build a Hedera-centric services practice, which Hedera customers can leverage to allow customers to get the most value out of Hedera.

The long-term success of Hedera Partners lies in two main areas - the development of strong service capabilities and participation in the Hedera community ecosystem.

# Partner Definitions

The official partner program consists of 3 partner categories:

- **Systems Integrators**: Systems integrators offer consulting and implementation services to support clients using Hedera Hashgraph across a wide range of application use cases. Hedera is committed to making it as easy as possible for systems integrators to build a profitable business through the implementation of Hedera Hashgraph.
- **Technology Partners**: Technology Partners help further decentralize the development of tools and services within the Hedera ecosystem. This includes features and functionalities found in the Hedera Services Code, as well as complementary tools that support application development, ease of use, network interoperability, and more.
- **Enterprise Applications**: Enterprise organizations are embracing disruption by incorporating Hedera Hashgraph into their ERP, CRM, EAM, HCM, and other SaaS offerings to deliver the benefits of decentralization. Join Hedera as an Enterprise Application Partner for exclusive access to technical development and architectural support, marketing, and thought leadership opportunities through the Hedera Enterprise Alliance.

# What is the Hedera Opportunity for Partners?

Hedera is the most used enterprise-grade public network with hundreds of thousands of users and 1.5 billion mainnet transactions processed to date. Hedera is more than just a DLT platform. It's a movement aiming to reinvent decentralized governance at scale.

As Partners develop their relationship with the Hedera ecosystem, they get numerous opportunities to take advantage of:

- Sales Support
- Technical Enablement
- Lead Sharing
- Personalized Demos
- Badges and Certification
- Sales Enablement
- Partner Directory listing
- Hedera User Group access
- Hedera Partner Discord access
- Council introductions
- Case studies build support
- Go-to-market initiatives (account planning, marketing events, and campaigns, conferences, etc.)

Our Business Development and Developer Advocacy teams are here to help you accelerate your services business centered around Hedera.

# Developing a Hedera Services Practice

Professional Services can become a major source of revenue for Partners as they help the Hedera ecosystem deploy, integrate and optimize their Hedera-based solutions.

Hedera heavily invests in expanding the ecosystem and raised awareness about the benefits and use-cases for its platform. We see many new organizations joining the Hedera ecosystem daily, and they require support, implementation consultancy, and hands-on technical skills to enable their solutions.

Below are the three steps Partners should take to get started with developing their Services practice:
